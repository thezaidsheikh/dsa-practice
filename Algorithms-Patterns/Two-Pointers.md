1. The Two Pointers Pattern
   This is the "bread and butter" of array manipulation. Instead of one index (i) moving through the array, you use two (i and j) to coordinate a result.


2. When to use two pointers
   Use two pointers when you need to process a part of an array (or string) in a linear fashion. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as:
   - Removing duplicates from an array
   - Finding the intersection of two arrays (finding the common elements)
   - Finding the longest substring in which all characters are distinct
   - Finding the minimum number of deletions required to make two strings anagrams
   - Finding the longest palindromic substring in a string
   - Finding the minimum number of swaps required to sort an array
   - Finding the minimum number of operations required to make two strings anagrams
   - Solving problems related to rotated sorted arrays

3. Why to use it
   - It helps to solve problems that can be solved in linear time by using constant space.
   - It helps to solve problems that can be solved in linear time complexity by using less space.
   - It helps to solve problems that can be solved in linear time by using less number of comparisons.
   - It helps to solve problems that can be solved in linear time by using less number of operations.
   - It helps to solve problems that can be solved in linear time by using less number of function calls.
   - It helps to solve problems that can be solved in linear time by using less number of iterations.


4. Common algorithms used with two pointers
   - Two Sum (find two numbers that sum to a target)
   - Container With Most Water (find the maximum area of a container filled with water)
   - Merge Two Sorted Arrays (merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array)
   - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (remove duplicate elements from a sorted array)
   - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II (remove duplicate elements from a sorted array while preserving the original order of the elements)
   - Three Sum (find three numbers that sum to a target)
   - 3Sum Closest (find the closest sum to a target among three numbers)
   - 4Sum (find all unique quadruplets that sum to a target)
   - 3Sum Smaller (find all triplets that sum to a target and smaller than the target)
   - Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II (remove duplicate elements from a sorted linked list)
   - Reverse Linked List II (reverse a linked list from position m to n)
   - Intersection of Two Linked Lists (find the node where two linked lists intersect)
   - Linked List Cycle II (detect a cycle in a linked list and return the node at the beginning of the cycle)
   - Remove Duplicates from Sorted List (remove duplicate elements from a sorted linked list)
   - Remove Element (remove all occurrences of an element from a sorted linked list)
